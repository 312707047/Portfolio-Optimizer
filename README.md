# Portfolio Optimizer

## 📊 Overview

This project implements a Portfolio Optimizer using advanced reinforcement learning techniques. It features:

- **TD3** (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)
- **DDPG** (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)
- A reproduction of the **EIIE** (Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators) model

The EIIE model is based on the paper "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Financial Portfolio Management Problem" by Jiang et al.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Custom implementation of TD3 algorithm
- ✅ Custom implementation of DDPG algorithm
- ✅ Reproduction of the EIIE model
- ✅ Custom Datasets using Yahoo finance and Binance API

## 🛠️ Getting Started
